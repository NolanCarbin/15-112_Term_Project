Project Description:
    Name - Dungeon Wizard
    Description - Dungeon Wizard is dungeon crawler video game, that has many randomized aspects, including randomly generated floors, monsters, items, etc. 

Competitive Analysis:
    1 paragraph analysis of similar projects, how my project will be similar or different to those:
    My project is very similar and takes inspiration from the game, The Binding of Isaac:Rebirth.
    Archelight will be similar in the ideas of having multiple floors with randomly generated rooms, that contain different monsters, bosses, items. All of these things will be generated randomly so that the player has a new exprience every time they play the game, just as The Binding of Isaac does it. The theme of the game will be different, instead of having a dark/religious theme, Archelight will be more adventurous with a wizard as the main character and different monsters such as skeletons, slims, zombies. 

Structural Plan:
    A plan for how the finalized project will be organized in different functions, files, and/or objects:
    All files will be stored in the 15-112_Term_Project folder.
    The main program will be kept in the app.py file, which will hold all of the main cmu_112_graphics functions, as well as all drawing functions. app.py will import the classes files which will hold the Room, Player, Monster, SpriteSheet classes. App.py will also import functions.py which will store all of the non-main functions. All images will be kept in the images folder

Algorithmic Plan:
    A detailed algorithmic plan for how I will approach the trickiest part of the project:
    The trickiest part of the project will be implementing the A* algorithm so that the monsters are trying to find/attack the player. 
        -First I need to understand how A*'s algorithm works. 
        -Then I need to figure out how to implement it in a non-grid format
        -Then I need to implement it into each monster in my monsters list 
    Another tricky part will be creating and implementing items that will affect the player
        -Once I have a list of items, possible in a Items object, I will be able to randomly select from the list and randomly place the item in a room 
    Another tricky part will be working around the OS key press delay, this is a crucial part that needs to be either fixed by changing the OS system settings for when the app is opened then changing it back when its closed. 
    Or somehow keeping track of the elapsed time from when the key is pressed and if the key is not released then that key needs to be called again so that it interupts the delay in the OS. 


Timeline Plan:
    Timeline for when the major features of the project will be completed:

    TP1: Floor class/object, Player class/object, Monster class/object, movement between rooms, player attack mechanics, 
        Floor randomized generation

    TP2: Monsters with A*, HUD(map/health), Sprites added, OS delay fixed

    TP3: 1 or 2 different bosses, Floor theme added, Items added

Version Control Plan:
    Short description and image demonstrating how I will use version control to back up my code.
    All code is being stored in my github account. I cloned the repository to my local files and update it using 
    github desktop. 

Module List:
    List of all outside modules:
    PIL/Pillow


TP2 Update:

The organization of the files has changed. Instead of grouping the different files by app, classes, functions, I am now grouping them as app, rooms, monsters, player, sprites. Each file contains the classes, functions, methods that are related to the named catergory. 
- There are three seperate spritesheets in the images folder. Sources are in the imageSrcs.txt file
- Instead of using A* algorithm, I only implemented BFS. Because of lack of level design and no actual additional costs to move around the room, I felt that A* wasn't necessary at this moment. However, if the level design complexity increases, I may or may not choose to implement A* or Dijkstra's Algorithm. 


Things completed since TP1:
    -Created a way to represent the room as a grid of pixels. 
    -Created algorithms to create an adjacency list(graph) for the rooms. 
    -Added BFS for monsters to find path to player, and moved them toward player.
    -Used BFS to find the farthest room generated to use as the boss room. 
    -Added health HUD for player and monsters/boss.
    -Spritesheet classes were created for the wizard/player, skeleton/monsters, and cyclops/boss.
    -Added Boss attacking mechanics (moves toward player, and shoots fire balls at players location)
    -Player can attack with both keys in cardnial directions and with mouse clicking in any directions
    -Player can only change room once all monster in the current room are dead. 
    -OS key pressed delay is much better. 
    -Added timers that call the lastkeypressed again if the timer goes over 0.02 seconds.


TP3 Updated:

Name changed to 'Dungeon Wizard'

Completed since TP2:
-Added obstacles(rocks)
    -player/monsters cannot move through rocks
-Added bat monster that uses bfs but follows the path until the end before searching for the player again
-Added 5 items to change the players mechanics
-Added when player picks up an item it displays the message/item picked up
-Added a mana mechanic 
-Added 2 health packs per floor in random rooms 
-Once player beats the boss, and goes down to the next floor, the monster move faster and attack harder
-Changed doors and added walls 
-Added a special attack with sprite
    -shoots in 8 directions and any monster touching the player when its used will take 2x damage
-Added a map when the player presses M
-Added a starting screen, a info screen, a winning screen
    -winning screen displays when player beats the 3rd floor boss and goes down the
