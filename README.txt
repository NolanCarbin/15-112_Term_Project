# 15-112_Term_Project
My 15-112 project is called Dungeon Wizard. 


A short description of the project's name and what it does. This may be taken from your design docs.

How to run the project. For example, which file the user should run in an editor. If your project uses data/source files, also describe how the user should set those up.

Which libraries you're using that need to be installed, if any. If you can include the library in the submission, that is preferred.

A list of any shortcut commands that exist. Shortcut commands can be used to demonstrate specific features by skipping forward in a game or loading sample data. They're useful for when you're testing your code too!




# Overview:
-Roguelike Game
-Everything is randomized
-Random Dungeon generator, that has multiple levels
-Multiple different enemies with different movement/attack mechanics
-A handful of bosses that increase in difficulty(goal: create 5 different bosses for 5 different levels, increase in difficulty as you go do in levels)
-Random objects/obstacles in side each room 
-Mini-map that keeps track of the rooms that have been seen
-Player has a health bar(each room should have a chance at giving more health back)
-Player only has one life
-Each floor has a boss room, once you beat the boss the player can go down a level(can't go back up)
-Once a player goes down a floor the data storing the floor above should clear the data so that the game doesn't get too slow. 
-Once the player enters a room the doors lock until the player defeats all of the monsters.
